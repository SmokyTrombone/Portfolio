title: Extrudable Polyster Characterisation
description:  The polyesters studied were destined for the flexible food packaging industry. The aim was to gather information of the product range at different steps of the productâ€™s lifespan such as extrusion, food packaging, in-store shelf life and customer usage.

Conducted tests to determine extrusion profiles.
Conducted sensory analysis tests to improve production process and customer satisfaction. Overcame health and safety concerns for the taste test during the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a temporary protocol and ensuring strict guidelines for the testers as well as the preparation.
Transverse team work to deliver detailed product analysis in strict timelines.
Collaboration with overseas colleagues.
Internal and external reports and presentations.
